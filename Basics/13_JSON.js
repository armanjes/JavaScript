âœ… JSON
ðŸš€ JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
ðŸš€ commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application as a text string.
ðŸš€ its file extension is .json

example:
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": true,
  "friends": ["Alice", "Bob"],
  "spouse": null,
  "address": {
    "city": "New York",
    "country": "USA"
  }
}

ðŸš€ JSON keys are always strings, enclosed in double quotes.
ðŸš€ Values can be any data type.
ðŸš€ JSON data is in the form of key-value pairs separated by commas
